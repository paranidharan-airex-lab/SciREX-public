"""Loss Function Implementation for 2D Poisson Inverse Problem.

This module implements the loss function for solving the inverse Poisson
equation with constant coefficient using neural networks. It focuses on
computing residuals in the weak form of the PDE for diffusion coefficient
identification.


Key functions:
    - pde_loss_poisson_inverse: Computes domain-based PDE loss for
      constant coefficient identification

Note:
    The implementation is based on the FastVPINNs methodology [1] for efficient
    computation of Variational residuals of PDEs.
